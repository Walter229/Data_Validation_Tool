## Exemplary Data Validation Tool
This an example of a tool that I've build during one of my internships.

The tool reads the Corporate Action data from multiple sources, compares their information and creates an Excel file that indicates for each CA, if the information can be found and validated in the different sources.
In a second step, after manual checking, the tool offer the possibility via VBA to generate an Excel sheet for all CAs that need to be added to an upload sheet.
